I am going to start my very first web development project on TOP wherein I am supposed to create the Google homepage from scratch.I am really excited for the project.
From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)
I tried very much for this project to look like the google searchpage but I'm not satisfied.I would like you to have a look at my source code and my project and any suggestions to improve my project are most welcome.
In this process I have learnt a lot and I think that the coming projects would be more challenging and fun.
